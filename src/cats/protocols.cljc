(ns cats.protocols
  "A collection of protocols upon which the cats abstractions are built.

  NOTE: Functions of this namespace are not intended to be used directly.
  It is considered internal api.")

(defprotocol Context
  "A marker protocol for identifying the valid context types.")

(defprotocol Contextual
  "Abstraction that establishes a concrete type as a member of a context.

  A great example is the Maybe monad type Just. It implements
  this abstraction to establish that Just is part of
  the Maybe monad."
  (-get-context [_] "Get the context associated with the type."))

(defprotocol Printable
  "An abstraction to make a type printable in a platform
  independent manner."
  (-repr ^String [_] "Get the repl ready representation of the object."))

(defprotocol Semigroup
  "A structure with an associative binary operation."
  (-mappend [s sv sv'] "An associative addition operation."))

(defprotocol Monoid
  "A Semigroup which has an identity element with respect to an associative binary operation."

(defprotocol Extract
  "A type class to extract the
  value from a monad context."
