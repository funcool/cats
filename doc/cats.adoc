== Introduction

Category Theory and algebraic abstractions for Clojure.

== Rationale

The main motivations for writing this library are:

* The existing libraries do not have support for ClojureScript.
* We do not intend to write a little Haskell inside Clojure. We have adopted a
  practical and Clojure like approach, always with correctness in mind.
* We do not like viral/copyleft like licenses and in contrast to other libraries
  cats is licensed under the BSD (2 clauses) license.
* We do not intend to only implement monads. Other category theory and algebraic abstractions
  are also first class in cats.


*Alternatives:*

* **algo.monads**: This is the official Clojure library for monads. Its approach for modeling
  monads is slightly limited, only supports the monad abstraction and does not have support for
  ClojureScript.
* **fluokitten**: Slightly unmaintaned by the original author. It is focused on being very practical
  without taking care of correctness (for example, it extends Clojure types with monadic abstractions
  that do not make sense). It has no support for ClojureScript either.
* **monads**: Is the most advanced monads library, supports also functors, applicatives and other
  related abstractions. It lacks a good and readable documentation, focus on correctness, has
  Haskell like sugar syntax (instead of Clojure like syntax) and does not have support for ClojureScript.

All listed alternatives are licensed with EPL or similar licenses.


== Project Maturity

Since _cats_ is a young project, there can be some link:api/index.html#id[API] breakage.


== Install

This section covers installing _cats_.


=== Leiningen

The simplest way to use _cats_ in a Clojure project is by including
it as a dependency in your *_project.clj_*:

[source,clojure]
----
[cats "0.4.0"]
----

=== Get the Code

_cats_ is open source and can be found on link:https://github.com/funcool/cats[github].

You can clone the public repository with this command:

[source,text]
----
git clone https://github.com/funcool/cats
----


== User Guide

This section introduces almost all the category theory and algebraic abstractions that the _cats_ library
supports.

We will use _Maybe_ for the example snippets, because it has support for all
the abstractions and is very easy to understand. You can read more about it in the next
section of this documentation.

=== Semigroup

A semigroup is an algebraic structure with an associative binary operation (`mappend`). Most of the builtin collections
form a semigroup because their associative binary operation is analogous to Clojure's `into`.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/mappend [1 2 3] [4 5 6])
;; => [1 2 3 4 5 6]
----

Given that the values it contains form a Semigroup, we can `mappend` multiple _Maybe_ values.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/mappend (maybe/just [1 2 3])
           (maybe/just [4 5 6]))
;; => #<Just [1 2 3 4 5 6]>
----

=== Monoid

A Monoid is a Semigroup with an identity element (`mempty`). For the collection types the `mempty`
function is analogous to Clojure's `empty`.

Given that the values it contains form a Semigroup, we can `mappend` multiple
_Maybe_, with Nothing being the identity element.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/mappend (maybe/just [1 2 3])
           (maybe/nothing)
           (maybe/just [4 5 6])
           (maybe/nothing))
;; => #<Just [1 2 3 4 5 6]>
----

=== Functor

Let's dive into the functor. The Functor represents some sort of "computational context", and the
abstraction consists of one unique function: *fmap*.

.Signature of *fmap* function
[source, clojure]
----
(fmap [f fv])
----

The higher-order function *fmap* takes a plain function as the first parameter and
a value wrapped in a functor context as the second parameter. It extracts the
inner value, applies the function to it and returns the result wrapped in same type
as the second parameter.

But what is the *functor context*? It sounds more complex than it is. A Functor
wrapper is any type that acts as "Box" and implements the `Context` and `Functor` protocols.

.One good example of a functor is the *Maybe* type:
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(maybe/just 2)
;; => #<Just 2>
----

The `just` function is a constructor of the Just type that is part of the Maybe monad.

Let's see one example of using *fmap* over a *just* instance:

.Example using fmap over *just* instance.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/fmap inc (maybe/just 1))
;; => #<Just 2>
----

The *Maybe* type also has another constructor: `nothing`. It represents the absence of a value.
It is a safe substitute for `nil` and may represent failure.

Let's see what happens if we perform the same operation as the previous example over a *nothing*
instance:

.Example using fmap over *nothing*.
[source, clojure]
----
(m/fmap inc (nothing))
;; => #<Nothing >
----

Oh, awesome, instead of raising a `NullPointerException`, it just returns *nothing*. Another
advantage of using the functor abstraction, is that it always returns a result
of the same type as its second argument.

Let's see an example of applying fmap over a Clojure vector:

.Example using fmav over *vector*.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.builtin])

(m/fmap inc [1 2 3])
;; => [2 3 4]
----

The main difference compared to the previous example with Clojure's map function, is that
map returns lazy seqs no matter what collection we pass to it:

[source, clojure]
----
(type (map inc [1 2 3]))
;; => clojure.lang.LazySeq (cljs.core/LazySeq in ClojureScript)
----

But why can we pass vectors to the `fmap` function? Because some Clojure container types like vectors,
lists and sets, also implement the functor abstraction. See the section on built-in types for more information.


=== Applicative

Let's continue with applicative functors. The Applicative Functor represents
some sort of "computational context" like a plain Functor, but with the ability to
execute a function wrapped in the same context.

The Applicative Functor abstraction consists of two functions: *fapply* and
*pure*.

.Signature of *fapply* function
[source, clojure]
----
(fapply [af av])
----

NOTE: the *pure* function will be explained later.

The use case for Applicative Functors is roughly the same as for plain Functors: safe
evaluation of some computation in a context.

Let's see an example to better understand the differences between functor and
applicative functor:

Imagine you have some factory function that, depending on the language, returns a
greeter function, and you only support a few languages.


[source, clojure]
----
(defn make-greeter
  [^String lang]
  (condp = lang
    "es" (fn [name] (str "Hola " name))
    "en" (fn [name] (str "Hello " name))
    nil))
----

Now, before using the resulting greeter you should always defensively check if
the returned greeter is a valid function or a nil value.

Let's convert this factory to use the Maybe type:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn make-greeter
  [^String lang]
  (condp = lang
    "es" (just (fn [name] (str "Hola " name)))
    "en" (just (fn [name] (str "Hello " name)))
    (nothing)))
----

As you can see, this version of the factory differs only slightly from the
original implementation. And this tiny change gives you a new superpower: you
can apply the returned greeter to any value without a defensive nil check:

[source, clojure]
----
(fapply (make-greeter "es") (just "Alex"))
;; => #<Just "Hola Alex">

(fapply (make-greeter "en") (just "Alex"))
;; => #<Just "Hello Alex">

(fapply (make-greeter "it") (just "Alex"))
;; => #<Nothing >
----

Moreover, the applicative functor comes with the *pure* function, which allows
you to put some value in side-effect-free context of the current type.

Examples:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(pure maybe/maybe-monad 5)
;; => #<Just 5>
----

If you do not understand the purpose of the *pure* function, the next section
should clarify its purpose.


=== Monad

Monads are the most discussed programming concept to come from category theory. Like functors and
applicatives, monads deal with data in contexts.

Additionally, monads can also transform contexts by unwrapping data, applying functions to it and
putting new values in a completely different context.

The monad abstraction consists of two functions: *bind* and *return*

.Bind function signature.
[source,clojure]
----
(bind [mv f])
----

As you can see, bind works much like a Functor but with inverted arguments. The main difference is
that in a monad, the function is responsible for wrapping a returned value in a context.

.Example usage of the bind higher-order function.
[source,clojure]
----
(m/bind (maybe/just 1)
        (fn [v] (maybe/just (inc v))))
;; => #<Just 2>
----

One of the key features of the bind function is that any computation executed within the context of
bind (monad) knows the context type implicitly. With this, if you apply some computation over some
monadic value and you want to return the result in the same container context but don't know
what that container is, you can use `return` or `pure` functions:

.Usage of return function in bind context.
[source,clojure]
----
(m/bind (maybe/just 1)
        (fn [v]
          (m/return (inc v))))
;; => #<Just 2>
----

The `return` or `pure` functions, when called with one argument, try to use the dynamic scope context
value that's set internally by the `bind` function. Therefore, you can't use them with one argument outside of a `bind` context.

We now can compose any number of computations using monad *bind*
functions. But observe what happens when the number of computations increases:

.Composability example of bind function.
[source, clojure]
----
(m/bind (maybe/just 1)
        (fn [a]
          (m/bind (maybe/just (inc a))
                  (fn [b]
                    (m/return (* b 2))))))
----

This can quickly lead to callback hell. To solve this, _cats_ comes with a powerful
macro: *mlet*

.Previous example but using *mlet* macro.
[source, clojure]
----
(m/mlet [a (maybe/just 1)
         b (maybe/just (inc a))]
  (m/return (* b 2)))
----

NOTE: If you are coming from Haskell, mlet represents the *do-syntax*.


If you want to use regular (non-monadic) let bindings inside an `mlet` block, you can do so using
`:let` and a binding vector inside the mlet bindings:

[source, clojure]
----
(m/mlet [a (maybe/just 1)
         b (maybe/just (inc a))
         :let [z (+ a b)]]
  (m/return (* z 2)))
----


=== MonadZero

Some monads also have the notion of an identity element analogous to that of Monoid. When calling `bind` on a identity element
for a monad, the same value is returned. This means that whenever we encounter the identity element in a monadic composition it will
short-circuit.

For the already familiar Maybe type the identity element is Nothing:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/mzero maybe/maybe-monad)
;; => #<Nothing >
----

Having an identity element we can make a monadic composition short-circuit using a predicate:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/bind (maybe/just 1)
        (fn [a]
          (m/bind (if (= a 2)
                    (m/return nil)
                    (m/mzero))
                  (fn [_]
                    (m/return (* a 2))))))
;; => #<Nothing >
----

As you can see in the above example the predicate `(= a 2)` returns either a monadic value `(m/return nil)` or the identity value
for the maybe monad. This can be captured in a function, which is available in `cats.core` namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn guard
  [b]
  (if b
    (return nil)
    (mzero)))
----

The above example could be rewritten as:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/bind (maybe/just 1)
        (fn [a]
          (m/bind (m/guard (= a 2))
                  (fn [_]
                    (m/return (* a 2))))))
;; => #<Nothing >
----

`mlet` has support for using guards using a `:when` clause, analogous to the one used in `for`. We could rewrite the above example
using `bind` with `mlet` and `:when`:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/mlet [a (maybe/just 1)
         :when (= a 2)]
   (m/return (* a 2)))
;; => #<Nothing >
----

Any monadic type that implements `MonadZero` can be combined with guards inside `mlet` bindings.

=== MonadPlus

MonadPlus is a complementary abstraction for Monads that support an associative binary operation, analogous to that of a
Semigroup. If the monad implements the MonadZero and MonadPlus protocols it forms a monoid.

For the Maybe type, `mplus` acts similarly to a logical OR that treats `Nothing` values as falsey.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/mplus (maybe/nothing))
;; => #<Nothing >

(m/mplus (maybe/nothing) (maybe/just 1))
;; => #<Just 1>

(m/mplus (maybe/just 1) (maybe/just 2))
;; => #<Just 1>
----


=== Monad Transformers

==== Motivation

We can combine two functors and get a new one automatically. Given any two functors _a_ and _b_,
we can implement a generic `fmap` for the type _a (b Any)_, we'll call it fmap2:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns functor.example
  (:require [cats.core :refer [fmap]]
            [cats.builtin]
            [cats.monad.maybe :refer [just]]))

(defn fmap2
  [f fv]
  (fmap (partial fmap f) fv))

; Here, 'a' is [] and 'b' is Maybe, so the type of the
; combined functor is a vector of Maybe values that could
; contain a value of any type.
(fmap2 inc [(maybe/just 1) (maybe/just 2)])
;; => [#<Just 2> #<Just 3>]
----

However, monads don't compose as nicely as functors do. We have to actually implement
the composition ourselves.

In some circumstances we would like combine the effects of two monads into another one. We call the
resulting monad a monad transformer, which is the composition of a "base" and "inner" monad. A
monad transformer is itself a monad.


==== Using monad transformers

Let's combine the effects of two monads: State and Maybe. We'll create the transformer
using State as the base monad since we want the resulting type to be a stateful computation
that may fail: `s -> Maybe (a, s)`.

Almost every monad implemented in _cats_ has a monad transformer for combining it with
any other monad. The transformer functions take a Monad as their argument and they
return a reified MonadTrans:

[source, clojure]
----
(ns transformers.example
  (:require [cats.core :as m]
            [cats.data :as data]
            [cats.monad.maybe :as maybe]
            [cats.monad.state :as state]))

(def maybe-state
  (state/state-transformer maybe/maybe-monad))

(m/with-monad maybe-state
  (state/run-state (m/return 42) {}))
;; => #<Just #<Pair [42 {}]>>
----

As we can see in the example below, the return of the `maybe-state` monad creates a stateful
function that yields a Maybe containing a pair (value, next state).

You probably noticed that we had to wrap the state function invocation with `cats.core/with-monad`.
When working with monad transformers, we have to be explicit about what monad we are using to implement
the binding policy since there is no way to distinguish values from a transformer type from those of
a regular monad.

The `maybe-state` monad combines the semantics of both State and Maybe.


== Types

=== Maybe

This is one of the two most used monad types (also known as Optional in other programming
languages).

The Maybe monad represents encapsulation of an optional value; e.g. it is used as the return type
of functions which may or may not return a meaningful value when they are applied. It consists
of either an empty constructor (called None or Nothing), or a constructor
encapsulating the original data type A (e.g. Just A or Some A).

_cats_, implements two types:

- `Just` that represents a value in a context.
- `Nothing` that represents the abscense of value.

.Example creating instances of `Just` and `Nothing` types:
[source, clojure]
----
(maybe/just 1)
;; => #<Just 1>

(maybe/nothing)
;; => #<Nothing >
----

There are other useful functions for working with maybe monad types in the same namespace.
See the API documentation for a full list of them. But here we will explain a little relevant subset
of them.

We mentioned above that *fmap* extracts the value from a functor context. You will also want to
extract values wrapped by *just* and you can do that with *from-maybe*.

As we said previously, the Just or Nothing instances act like wrappers and in some circumstances
you will want extract the plain value from them. cats offers the `from-maybe` function for that.

.Example using *from-maybe* to extract values wrapped by *just*.
[source, clojure]
----
(maybe/from-maybe (maybe/just 1))
;; => 1

(maybe/from-maybe (maybe/nothing))
;; => nil

(maybe/from-maybe (maybe/nothing) 42)
;; => 42
----

The `from-maybe` function is a specialized version of a more generic one: `cats.core/extract`.
The generic version is a polymorphic function and will also work with different
types of different monads.

For interoperability with Clojure and ClojureScript's `IDeref` abstraction, maybe values are
derrefable.

.Example using *deref* to extract values wrapped by *just*.
[source, clojure]
----
(deref (maybe/just 1))
;; => 1

(deref (maybe/nothing))
;; => nil
----

=== Either

Either is another type that represents a result of a computation, but (in contrast with maybe)
it can return some data with a failed computation result.

In _cats_ it has two constructors:

- `(left v)`: represents a failure.
- `(right v)`: represents a successful result.

.Usage example of *Either* constructors.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.monad.either :refer :all])

(right :valid-value)
;; => #<Right [:valid-value :right]>

(left "Error message")
;; => #<Either [Error message :left]>
----

NOTE: Either is also (like Maybe) a Functor, Applicative Functor and Monad.

Like Maybe, Either values can be dereferenced returning the value they contain.

=== Exception

Also known as the Try monad, as popularized by Scala.

It represents a computation that may either result in an exception or return a successfully computed
value. Is very similar to the Either monad, but is semantically different.

It consists of two types: Success and Failure. The Success type is a simple
wrapper, like Right of the Either monad. But the Failure type is slightly different
from Left, because it always wraps an instance of Throwable (or any value in cljs since you can
throw arbitrary values in the JavaScript host).

The most common use case of this monad is to wrap third party libraries that use standard Exception
based error handling. Under normal circumstances, however, you should use Either instead.

It is an analogue of the try-catch block: it replaces try-catch's stack-based error handling with
heap-based error handling. Instead of having an exception thrown and having to deal with it immediately
in the same thread, it disconnects the error handling and recovery.

.Usage example of *try-on* macro.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.monad.exception :as exc])

(exc/try-on 1)
;; => #<Success [1]>

(exc/try-on (+ 1 nil))
;; => #<Failure [#<NullPointerException java.lang.NullPointerException>]>
----

_cats_ comes with other syntactic sugar macros: `try-or-else` that returns a default value if a
computation fails, and `try-or-recover` that lets you handle the return value when executing a
function with the exception as first parameter.

.Usage example of `try-or-else` macro.
[source, clojure]
----
(exc/try-or-else (+ 1 nil) 2)
;; => #<Success [2]>
----

.Usage example of `try-or-recover` macro.
[source, clojure]
----
(exc/try-or-recover (+ 1 nil)
                    (fn [e]
                      (cond
                        (instance? NullPointerException e) 0
                        :else 100)))
;; => #<Success [0]>
----

The types defined for the Exception monad (Success and Failure) also implement the Clojure IDeref
interface, which allows library development using monadic composition without forcing a user of
that library to use or understand monads.

That is because when you dereference the failure instance, it will reraise the
enclosed exception.

.Example dereferencing a failure instance
[source, clojure]
----
(def f (exc/try-on (+ 1 nil)))

@f
;; => NullPointerException   clojure.lang.Numbers.ops (Numbers.java:961)
----


=== State

The State monad is one of the special cases of monads most commonly used in
Haskell. It has several purposes including: lazy computation, composition, and
maintaining state without explicitly passing it to every function manualy.

The de-facto monadic type of the state monad is a plain function. A function
represents a computation as is (without executing it). Obviously, a function
should have some special characteristics to work in monad state composition.

.Valid function for the state monad
[source, clojure]
----
(fn [state]
  "Takes a state as argument and returns a vector
  with the first element being the processed value and
  the second element being the new transformed state."
  (let [newvalue (first state)
        newstate (next state)]
    [newvalue newstate]))
----

You just saw an example of the low-level primitive state monad. For basic usage
you do not need to write your own functions, just use some helpers that _cats_ provides.

Let's look at one example before explaining the details:

.Lazy composition of computations
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.state :as st])

(m/mlet [state (st/get-state)
         _     (st/put-state (next state))]
  (m/return (first state)))
;; => #<State cats.monad.state.State@2eebabb6>
----

At the moment of evaluation in the previous expression, nothing of what we have defined
is executed. But instead of returning the unadorned final value of the computation,
a strange/unknown object of type *State* is returned.

The State type is simply a wrapper for Clojure functions, nothing more.

Now, it's time to execute the composed computation. We can use one of the following
functions exposed by _cats_ for that: `run-state`, `eval-state` and `exec-state`.

- `run-state` executes the composed computation and returns both the value and the
  final state.
- `eval-state` executes the composed computation and returns the resulting
  value, discarding the state.
- `exec-state` executes the composed computation and returns only the resulting
  state, ignoring the resulting value.

.Example of resuls of using the previosly listed functions
[source, clojure]
----
(m/run-state s [1 2 3])
;; => #<Pair [1 (2 3)]>

(m/eval-state s [1 2 3])
;; => 1

(m/exec-state s [1 2 3])
;; => (2 3)
----

The `run-state` function returns an instance of the Pair type. The Pair type acts like any other seq in
Clojure with the exception that it can only contain two values.


=== Reader

The reader monad is another commonly used monad in Haskell. It's used for gluing together computations that
depend on a read-only environment. As with the state monad, we don't have to thread the environment manualy
since the monadic bind does it for us. The type of the reader monad are one-argument functions.

The Reader type is analogous to State, simply a wrapper for regular Clojure functions. If we want our functions
to participate in the reader abstraction we have to wrap them in a Reader instance.

.Valid function for the reader monad
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.monad.reader :as r])

(def start-server
  (r/reader
    (fn [env]
      "Takes an environment with options as an argument and runs a web
       server in the address specified by `:host` and `:port`."
      (run-http-server (:host env) (:port env)))))
----

cats provides a few reader functions already. `ask` is the simplest reader, simply returns the environment. We
can execute readers using the `run-reader` function which accepts a reader and an environment.

.Example of running the ask reader
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.monad.reader :as r])

(r/run-reader r/ask [1 2 3])
;; => [1 2 3]
----

Let's use `mlet` for building new readers out of existing ones:

.Example of composing reader computations
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.reader :as r])

(m/mlet [env r/ask]
  (m/return (inc env)))
;; => #<Reader cats.monad.reader.Reader@2eebabb6>
----

We can then run it using `run-reader`:

.Example of composing reader computations
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.reader :as r])

(r/run-reader (m/mlet [env r/ask]
                (m/return (inc env)))
              41)
;; => 42
----

We can also alter the reader's environment in a context using the `local` function which given a function and
a reader returns a new reader whose environment is the result of applying the first function given to `local` to
the original environment. Let's see it in action to understand it better:

.Example of composing reader computations
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.reader :as r])

(r/run-reader (m/mlet [env (r/local #(* 2 %) r/ask)]
                (m/return (+ env 2)))
              20)
;; => 42
----

Note that since we executed `ask` with the function `#(*2 %)` altering its original environment (20), the resulting
`env` value is two times the original environment.

=== Writer

The writer monad comes from Haskell too. It's used for accumulating a log together with the values generated by
computations. As with the state and reader monads, we don't have to explicitly thread the log manually since
the monadic bind takes care of that. The type

=== Validation

The validation type is similar to the Either or Exception types except that it
doesn't implement a Monad instance. It has two constructors: `ok` and `fail`,
representing success and failure respectively.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.applicative.validation :as v])
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(v/ok 42)
;; => #<Ok 42>

(v/fail [])
;; => #<Fail []>
----

It implements the Applicative protocol, and its intended usage is as an Applicative. Applying Validation
values together errs on the side of the failure, and applying failures together aggregates their values
using the Semigroup's `mappend` function.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[cats.applicative.validation :as v])
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/fapply (v/ok 42) (v/fail "OH NOES"))
;; => #<Fail "OH NOES">

;; Note that `<*>` is a variadic fapply
(m/<*> (v/ok 42)
       (v/fail {:foo "bar"})
       (v/fail {:baz "fubar"})
       (v/ok 99))
;; => #<Fail {:baz "fubar", :foo "bar"}>
----

=== Built in types

Some of the abstractions in _cats_ are implemented for built-in types but you can't use them directly. First,
you must load the `cats.builtin` namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(use 'cats.builtin)
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/fmap inc [1 2 3 4])
;; => [2 3 4 5]
----

==== nil

Given the fact that `nil` is both a value and a type, we have extended the `nil` type to be equivalent
to Maybe monad's `Nothing`. This means that you can use `nil` as if were a `Just` instance like in the
following example:

[source, clojure]
----
(use 'cats.builtin)
(require '[cats.core :as m])
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(m/mlet [x (maybe/just 42)
         y nil]
  (m/return (+ x y)))
;; => nil
----

As you can see, the `mlet` short-circuits when encountering a `nil` value.


==== Vector

Clojure vectors also participate in several of the abstractions implemented in _cats_, most notably
as a monad. Compare the following `for` comprehension:

[source, clojure]
----
(for [x [1 2]
      y [3 4 5]]
   (+ x y))
;; => (4 5 6 5 6 7)
----

with the equivalent using _mlet_:

[source, clojure]
----
(use 'cats.builtin)
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/mlet [x [1 2]
         y [3 4 5]]
  (m/return (+ x y)))
;; => [4 5 6 5 6 7]
----

Note the symmetry between `for` and `mlet`. This is not accidental, both are what is called a monad comprehension,
the difference is that `for` is limited to sequences and `mlet` can work with arbitrary monads.

Also, since `mlet` desugars into calls to the Monad's `bind` function, its result keeps the type of the monadic values.

==== Lazy sequences

Lazy sequences implement the same abstractions as vectors with practically an identical implementation. If you don't need
the results right away or are interested in a subset of the final results, you can use lazy sequence comprehensions.

Using `mlet` with lazy sequences yields exactly the same result as using `for`:

[source, clojure]
----
(use 'cats.builtin)
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/mlet [x (lazy-seq [1 2])
         y (lazy-seq [3 4 5])]
  (m/return (+ x y)))
;; => (4 5 6 5 6 7)
----

==== Set

Sets implement almost every abstraction in _cats_, from Semigroup to Monad.

[source, clojure]
----
(use 'cats.builtin)
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/pure set-monad 42)
;; => #{42}

(m/fmap inc #{1 2 3 4})
;; => #{4 3 2 5}

(m/bind #{1 2 3}
        (fn [v] #{v (inc v)}))
;; => #{1 4 3 2}
----

==== Map

Maps implement the _Semigroup_ protocol, since we can use `merge` as their associative binary operation. Using
`mappend` on maps is a way to merge them together:

[source, clojure]
----
(use 'cats.builtin)
(require '[cats.core :as m])

(m/mappend {:a "A"} {:b "B"})
;; => {:a "A", :b "B"}
----

Since we can consider the empty map an identity element for the `mappend` associative binary operation maps also
implement _Monoid_ and the `mempty` function gives an empty map.


=== Complementary libraries

Some monads are defined as separated package to avoid additional
and unnecesary dependencies to cats. Also, there are some libraries
that build higher-level abstractions on top of what cats offers.

* Promise monad: https://github.com/funcool/promesa
* Concurrent data fetching: https://github.com/kachayev/muse


== FAQ

=== What Clojure types implement some of the Category Theory abstractions?

In contrast to other similar libraries in Clojure, _cats_ doesn't intend to extend Clojure types
that don't act like containers. For example, Clojure keywords are values but can not be containers so
they should not extend any of the previously explained protocols.

== How to Contribute?

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _cats_ should keep these important rules in mind.


=== Procedure

_cats_ does not have many restrictions for contributions. Just follow these
steps depending on the situation:

*Bugfix*:

- Fork the GitHub repo.
- Fix a bug/typo on a new branch.
- Make a pull-request to master.

*New feature*:

- Open new issue with the new feature proposal.
- If it is accepted, follow the same steps as "bugfix".
