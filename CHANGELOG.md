## Version 2.0.0 ##

Date: 2016-07-28

This version intend to clean the library from unused and out of context stuff
and leave only the useful abstractions. This is a list of main changes (mostly
breaking):

- Removed support for monad transformers. They add too many complex to the
  implementation but in return adds very low value in context of dynamic
  languages as is clojure.
- Removed state, writer, reader and continuation monad namespaces.  They are not
  very useful in clojure so having them without any particular usefulness it not
  make sense.
- Removed `cats.applicative` namespace because it is too many opinionated and
  not really useful in the real world. The use case vary depending on when that
  abstraction is used so we encourage users to define their own abstraction with
  specific behavior for their application.
- Removed CRDT's labs. It was an experiment and the final sensacion is that is
  not very useful and in most circumstances the users defines their own
  datastructures instead of rely on ones from third party packages. So,
  maintaining them in the code base also does not make sense
- Removed `lens` and `traversals` namespaces. The first one becomes very useful
  and is properly externalized as [separated package][1]. The last one, seems
  like it is not very useful and seems out of context of cats library. If anyone
  is interested in maintaining it, the code can be extracted from the previos
  git revisions and released as separated library.
- Move `cats.labs.sugar` into `cats.core` namespace (`cats.labs.sugar` ns is
  removed)

And a list of other changes and contributions:

- PersistentListq support in sequence context (@muhuk)
- Rewrite `cats.labs.channel` integration with core.async combinators
  (@yanatan16)
- Add `cats.builtin.lazy-sequence-context` (@muhuk)
- Fix bug in sequence context's fapply implementation (@muhuk)
- Performance improvements in sequence context implementation (@muhuk)
- Add `cats.monad.either/try-either` macro for capturing exceptions as left, values
  as right (@shmish111)
- Move `promesa.monad` namespace under `cats.labs.promise` ns.

## Version 1.0.0 ##

Date: 2015-09-17

### Bug fixes

- The context doesn't need to be a monad anymore.
- Fix Foldable implementation for clojure builtin collections.

### New features

- Add additional arity to `cats.core/mempty` function, that allows provide a context
  instead of resolving it.
- Sorted map is now also implements monoid.
- Add `cats.labs` namespace for make room for previously removed **reader**, **writer**,
  **state** and **continuation** monads.
- Add core.async channel monad/applicative under `cats.labs.channel` namespace.
- Add manifold deferred monad/applicative under `cats.labs.manifold` namespace.
- Add **applicative-do** (with `alet` macro) syntax. You can read more about that in
  [haskell wiki](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ApplicativeDo) and
  [pull request](https://github.com/funcool/cats/pull/63).
- Add **foldm** implementation to `cats.core` namespace.
- Add a bunch of monoids: `all`, `any`, `sum`, `prod`, `pair` and `string`.
- Add a [Traversable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Data-Traversable.html)
  protocol and implementations for vector, sequence, pair, maybe, either and validation.
- Add **traverse** function to `cats.core` namespace.

### Backwards incompatible changes

- Revisit monad-transformers abstraction removing useless protocol methods: `base` and `inner`
  are no longer part of the `MonadTrans` protocol.
- The protocols methods are all renamed to `-name` for consistency with cljs style to
  name internal functions.
- The `Context` protocol has been renamed to `Contextual`, and `Context` is now a protocol
  used to mark context instances and resolve their priority.


## Version 0.6.1 ##

Date: 2015-08-02

- Remove src/user.clj that causes some problems.


## Version 0.6.0 ##

Date: 2015-08-02

- Foldable abstraction.
- Curry facilities.
- Major code cleaning.
- Context management moved into its own namespace.
- A lot of performance improvements (removing unnecessary
  function call forwarding).
- Start using the clojurescript 1.7.28.


## Version 0.5.0 ##

Date: 2015-07-13

- Set default and required clojure version to 1.7.0.
- Replace cljx with clojure 1.7 conditional reader.
- Add more util functions for treat for maybe monad types.
- Add more util functions for treat for either monad types.
- Add semigroup and monoid abstractions.
- Add validation applicative (similar to either).
- Minor performance improvements.
- Fix inconsistences between fmap / fapply public functions
  and its haskell-style aliases.
- Add more documentation.
- Deprecate the state, reader, writer and continuation
  monads. They will be moved to a separated library for
  future version.
- Remove already deprecated `from-either` function.


## Version 0.4.0 ##

Date: 2015-03-25

- The exception monad now raises a exception when you deref a failure instance.
  This will allow easy use of monadic api from libraries or applications that
  does not  use monads.
- The `cats.monad.exception/failure` function now coerce all input that not
  extends from exception to exception type (using `ex-info` clojure function).
- Add channel monad using core.async channels abstraction (as separated repository)
  This make easy treat channels as monads and using them in monadic compositions.
- Remove mlet-with macro (bacause it sintax is ugly and with-monad usage is preferable)
- Remove undocumented errlet macro.


## Version 0.3.4 ##

Date: 2015-03-14

- Improve cljx build process.


## Version 0.3.3 ##

  allow remove wrong uploaded versions.

- Update required clojurescript version to 0.0-2760.
- Use speclj for tests.
